## ‚ú® Features

- **Live Log Streaming**: Real-time logs from all running Docker containers
- **Grid Layout**: Beautiful, organized grid view with automatic container arrangement
- **Color-Coded Containers**: Each container gets a unique color for easy identification
- **Minimal & Clean**: Focus on logs with a distraction-free interface
- **Keyboard Controls**: Simple and intuitive navigation
- **No Configuration**: Works out of the box with your Docker setup

## üöÄ Installation

### Option 1: Install with Go
```bash
go install github.com/berkantay/colog@latest
```

### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/berkantay/colog.git
cd colog
go build -o colog
sudo mv colog /usr/local/bin/
```

### Option 3: Download Binary
Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/berkantay/colog/releases)

## üìã Requirements

- Docker installed and running
- Docker daemon accessible (usually via `/var/run/docker.sock`)
- At least one running Docker container

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Show logs from all running containers
colog
```

The application will automatically:
1. **Discover** all running Docker containers
2. **Arrange** them in an optimal grid layout
3. **Stream** live logs from each container in real-time
4. **Color-code** each container with unique borders and titles

### Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Docker running with at least one active container
2. Run `colog` in your terminal
3. Watch live logs stream from all containers simultaneously
4. Use keyboard controls to interact with the application

### Help
```bash
colog --help
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `q` | Quit application | Cleanly exit Colog and return to terminal |
| `g` | Export logs | Export last 50 log lines from each container for LLM analysis |
| `Tab` | Navigate containers | Switch focus between different container log panels |
| `Ctrl+C` | Force quit | Immediately terminate the application |

### Navigation Tips
- **Container Focus**: Use `Tab` to cycle through containers and highlight the active panel
- **Log Export**: Press `g` to quickly export recent logs for analysis or sharing
- **Clean Exit**: Always use `q` for a proper shutdown that ensures all resources are cleaned up

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Container Discovery**: Connects to Docker daemon and lists all running containers
2. **Grid Layout**: Automatically arranges containers in an optimal grid layout
3. **Live Streaming**: Opens log streams for each container using Docker API
4. **Real-time Updates**: Continuously displays new log entries with timestamps
5. **Color Coding**: Assigns unique colors to container borders and titles

## üé® Features in Detail

### Grid Layout
- Automatically calculates optimal rows/columns based on container count
- Square-ish layout for best screen utilization
- Each container gets equal space

### Color System
- 14 distinct colors cycle through containers
- Border and title colors match for easy identification
- Readable color combinations for all terminal themes

### Log Format
- Timestamps in `HH:MM:SS` format
- Clean log parsing that handles Docker's log format
- Scrollable view with automatic scroll-to-end

## üîß Development

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- Docker
- Terminal with color support

### Building
```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o colog
```

### Dependencies
- `github.com/rivo/tview` - Terminal UI framework
- `github.com/docker/docker` - Docker client library
- `github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2` - Terminal handling

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No running containers found"
- Make sure Docker is running: `docker ps`
- Ensure you have running containers: `docker run -d nginx`

### "Failed to connect to Docker"
- Check Docker daemon is running: `systemctl status docker`
- Verify Docker socket permissions: `ls -la /var/run/docker.sock`
- On macOS, ensure Docker Desktop is running

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Add user to docker group (Linux)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then log out and back in
```
